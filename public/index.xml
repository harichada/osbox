      <description>Introduction Cybersecurity has become a critical issue in today&amp;rsquo;s world since the number and sophistication of attacks are constantly increasing. One of the most challenging tasks in cybersecurity is the detection of network intrusion. Traditional network intrusion detection techniques, such as signature-based intrusion detection systems (IDS), are not effective against zero-day attacks that are not yet known to the system. Thus, machine learning-based intrusion detection techniques have emerged as a promising solution to detect and prevent such attacks.</description>
