<p>What is a System Snapshot?</p>
<p>A system snapshot is an image of a computer&rsquo;s hard drive at a specific moment in time. They&rsquo;re generally taken before making any significant changes to your system, such as a software update or installing new hardware. When taking a snapshot, the current state of the system is captured, which may include files and settings, as well as system files.</p>
<p>How to Create System Snapshots</p>
<p>There are many ways to create system snapshots, but the most common method is to use a backup tool. In this section, we will review the steps involved in creating a system snapshot using the built-in tools on Windows and macOS.</p>
