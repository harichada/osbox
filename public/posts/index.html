      Introduction
The world is moving towards automation, and supply chain management is no exception. Traditional supply chain management relies heavily on human intervention, which is often labor-intensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. To address these shortcomings, supply chain management is now exploring the possibilities of AI-based autonomous systems. In this blog post, we will explore &ldquo;AI Inaugurated Autonomous Supply Chain Management.&rdquo;
What is Autonomous Supply Chain Management?
Autonomous supply chain management is the process of automating supply chain management activities through the use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, blockchain, etc.

      Automated Backups Using Cron Jobs
Backing up your data is crucial in ensuring that your crucial files are protected in case of system failures or data breaches. However, manually backing up your files can be time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to errors. Automation can help solve these issues.
Cron is a time-based job scheduler that allows you to schedule repetitive tasks on Linux systems. It is an essential tool for automating critical system maintenance tasks, including backups.

      Automated Data Classification with Machine Learning
Data classification is a vital part of any data management process. It involves organizing and categorizing data according to specific parameters, so it can be more easily understood and analyzed. Traditionally, data classification has been a manual process that involves going through data and identifying its relevant attributes. However, this is a time-consuming and tedious process that can be prone to errors. Fortunately, advances in machine learning have made automated data classification possible, bringing significant benefits to data management.
