<h2 id="what-is-deep-learning">What is Deep Learning?</h2>
<p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks to recognize patterns in data. In simple terms, a deep learning model is composed of multiple layers of connected nodes that process and transform data into useful outputs. By tweaking the architecture and parameters of these networks, deep learning algorithms can learn to recognize complex patterns and relationships in data, making them well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-speech-recognition-using-deep-learning-work">How Does Speech Recognition using Deep Learning Work?</h2>
<p>Speech recognition is a process of transcribing spoken language into written text. The input to the system is the audio signal, which is a continuous waveform of sound pressure levels captured by a microphone. The first step in speech recognition is to preprocess the audio signal by converting it into a spectrogram, which represents the frequency content of the audio signal over time.</p>
<p>The next step is to extract features from the spectrogram, such as the spectral envelope, pitch, and phonemes (basic units of sound in a language). These features are then fed into a deep learning model, which is trained to map the input features to the corresponding output text.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular deep learning architectures used for speech recognition are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformer Networks. CNNs are used to extract spatial features from the spectrogram, while RNNs and Transformers are used for modeling temporal dependencies in the speech signal.</p>
<p>Once the model is trained, it can be used to transcribe new audio signals in real-time by applying the same processing steps to the input signal and predicting the corresponding output text.</p>
<p>Here is an example code snippet of a speech recognition model using a CNN-RNN architecture with the Keras library in Python:</p>
