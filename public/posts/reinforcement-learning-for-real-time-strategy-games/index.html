<p>Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games are complex systems that require advanced strategies and decision-making skills. Traditional game AI algorithms rely on pre-programmed rules or handcrafted heuristics, and as such, they cannot fully adapt to the game&rsquo;s dynamics. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach to overcoming this challenge. In this post, we will delve into the details of reinforcement learning for real-time strategy games.</p>
<p>What is Reinforcement Learning?</p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is a form of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with its environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of a reward or penalty for each action it takes, and it aims to maximize its rewards over time. Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, RL algorithms do not require pre-labeled data, making it suitable for dynamic and uncertain environments.</p>
<p>The RL framework consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment: The environment provides feedback to the agent based on its actions.</li>
<li>Agent: The agent interacts with the environment, observes the rewards, and learns from its experiences.</li>
<li>Policy: The policy determines the agent&rsquo;s actions based on the current state and previous experiences.</li>
<li>Reward function: The reward function specifies the goal of the RL task and the feedback given to the agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Strategy Games</p>
<p>Real-time strategy games are highly complex environments with multiple agents that interact in real-time. Unlike turn-based games, RTS games require fast and continuous decision-making, making them challenging for traditional AI algorithms. RL offers a promising approach to tackle this issue by allowing agents to learn from their interactions with the environment.</p>
<p>RL algorithms for RTS games can be categorized as model-based or model-free. Model-based algorithms learn a model of the game&rsquo;s dynamics and use this model to make decisions. On the other hand, model-free algorithms learn directly from the experience without requiring a model.</p>
<p>Model-based RL for RTS Games</p>
<p>Model-based RL algorithms for RTS games learn a model of the game&rsquo;s dynamics, which includes the state transition probabilities and the reward function. Once the model is learned, the agent can use it to make optimal decisions using techniques such as Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).</p>
<p>Value Iteration and Policy Iteration are dynamic programming algorithms that compute the optimal value function or policy. Value Iteration updates the value function by taking the maximum expected reward over all possible actions in each state until convergence. Policy Iteration iteratively updates the policy and the value function until convergence.</p>
<p>MCTS is a planning algorithm that builds a search tree by simulating possible action sequences and selects the most promising ones. MCTS has been shown to be effective in commercial RTS games such as StarCraft.</p>
<p>Model-free RL for RTS Games</p>
<p>Model-free RL algorithms for RTS games learn directly from the experience without requiring a model. These algorithms can be categorized as on-policy or off-policy.</p>
<p>On-policy algorithms, such as SARSA and Q-learning, learn the optimal policy by following it and updating the Q-function based on the observed rewards. SARSA updates the Q-function using a temporal-difference error, and Q-learning updates the Q-function using the maximum expected reward over all possible actions in the next state.</p>
<p>Off-policy algorithms, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Double DQN, learn a separate target Q-function and use it to estimate the expected reward. DQN uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function, and Double DQN uses a similar architecture but with two separate networks to reduce overestimation.</p>
<p>Code Snippets</p>
<p>Here are some code snippets that demonstrate the basic implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms for RTS games.</p>
<p>SARSA:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    action = agent.select_action(state)
    done = False
    while not done:
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_action = agent.select_action(next_state)
        agent.update(reward, state, action, next_state, next_action, done)
        state = next_state
        action = next_action
</code></pre><p>DQN:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.update(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
</code></pre><p>Additional Resources</p>
