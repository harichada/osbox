<p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks to find solutions to complex problems. It is a type of artificial intelligence that is able to learn and identify patterns in large data sets. TensorFlow and Keras are two of the most popular deep learning platforms available today.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore the basics of deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras. We will also look at how to set up and run deep learning models using these platforms.</p>
<p>What is TensorFlow?</p>
<p>TensorFlow is an open-source software library developed by Google for building and training machine learning models. It takes a set of input data and trains a model based on the patterns in the data. TensorFlow is highly flexible and can be used with a variety of programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of TensorFlow is its scalability. It can be used to train models on small data sets as well as very large data sets. This makes it a great choice for businesses and organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p>What is Keras?</p>
<p>Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python that is designed to run on top of TensorFlow. It provides a user-friendly interface for building neural networks and is often used by beginners to deep learning. Keras is easy to use and can be used to build a variety of neural network models such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and more.</p>
<p>Keras allows you to easily build and run deep learning models with just a few lines of code. It has a large community of developers who are constantly adding new features and improving the library.</p>
<p>Setting up TensorFlow and Keras</p>
<p>To get started with TensorFlow and Keras, you will need to install both libraries onto your computer. The easiest way to do this is to use pip, the package installer for Python. Open a command prompt or terminal and enter the following commands:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
</code></pre><p>Once both libraries are installed, you can start building and running models.</p>
<p>Building a neural network with Keras</p>
<p>To build a neural network with Keras, you first need to import the libraries and define the model architecture. Here is an example of a simple neural network that can classify images:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> tensorflow <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> tf

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Define the model architecture</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    keras<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>layers<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>Dense(<span style="color:#ae81ff">128</span>, activation<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;relu&#39;</span>),

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>])
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Compile the model</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>model<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>compile(optimizer<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;adam&#39;</span>,

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>              metrics<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;accuracy&#39;</span>])
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code defines a neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer with 128 neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons (one for each class of image). The &lsquo;relu&rsquo; activation function is used for the hidden layer and the &lsquo;softmax&rsquo; activation function is used for the output layer.</p>
<p>The model is then compiled with an &lsquo;adam&rsquo; optimizer, which is a type of gradient descent algorithm, and a &lsquo;sparse_categorical_crossentropy&rsquo; loss function, which is used for multiclass classification problems. The accuracy metric is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training.</p>
<p>Training a neural network with TensorFlow</p>
<p>Once the model is defined, you can train it using TensorFlow. Here is an example of how to train the model using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> tensorflow <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> tf

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Load the MNIST dataset</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Normalize the data</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>test_images <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> test_images <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">255.0</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code loads the MNIST dataset and normalizes the input data values to be between 0 and 1. The model is then trained for 10 epochs using the &lsquo;fit&rsquo; method. The validation data is used to evaluate the performance of the model on a set of data that it has not seen before.</p>
