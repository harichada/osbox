<p>Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a method of disk management and expansion that allows for the creation of logical volumes (LVs) from physical volumes (PVs) to provide flexible and dynamic disk space management. It is used on systems that have a need for increased storage capacity, such as a server or a workstation. In this post, we will discuss how to use LVM for disk management and expansion.</p>
<p>Creating Physical Volumes</p>
<p>Before we can use LVM, we need to create physical volumes. A physical volume can be created on a block device such as a partition, a whole disk, or even a RAID array. In this example, let us assume we have a spare, unused SSD drive connected to our system as /dev/sdb.</p>
<p>We can initialize the disk, create a partition table, and add a partition to it using fdisk as shown below:</p>
<p>$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
e   extended
Select (default p): p
Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
First sector (2048-1048575, default 2048):
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-1048575, default 1048575):
Created a new partition 1 of type &lsquo;Linux&rsquo; and of size 511 MiB.</p>
<p>We can now create a physical volume on the new partition by running:</p>
<p>$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
Physical volume &ldquo;/dev/sdb1&rdquo; successfully created.</p>
<p>Creating Volume Groups</p>
<p>After creating physical volumes, we will group them into logical units known as volume groups (VGs). A volume group is a pool of physical volumes that can be used to create logical volumes. For example, we can create a volume group called myvg that contains our newly created physical volume /dev/sdb1:</p>
<p>$ sudo vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb1
Volume group &ldquo;myvg&rdquo; successfully created</p>
<p>Creating Logical Volumes</p>
<p>Now that we have a volume group, we can create logical volumes to store data. A logical volume is similar to a traditional partition but is much more flexible since it can be resized dynamically without the need to unmount the filesystem. For example, we can create a logical volume called mylv that consumes 80% of the free space in the volume group:</p>
<p>$ sudo lvcreate -l 80%FREE -n mylv myvg
Logical volume &ldquo;mylv&rdquo; created.</p>
<p>Next, we need to create a filesystem on the logical volume to contain data. We can choose any filesystem we want, but in this example, we&rsquo;ll use ext4:</p>
<p>$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv
mke2fs 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)
Creating filesystem with 196608 4k blocks and 49152 inodes
Filesystem UUID: fbef0e7c-4960-4f7e-b838-ecda9407b443
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
32768, 98304, 163840</p>
<p>Finally, we can mount the logical volume to a directory so that we can access and store data on it:</p>
<p>$ sudo mkdir /mnt/mylv
$ sudo mount /dev/myvg/mylv /mnt/mylv</p>
<p>Expanding Logical Volumes</p>
<p>One of the best features of LVM is the ability to expand logical volumes even while they&rsquo;re in use. We can expand the logical volume we created earlier by running:</p>
<p>$ sudo lvresize -L +10G /dev/myvg/mylv
Size of logical volume myvg/mylv changed from <!-- raw HTML omitted --> GiB (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> extents) to &lt;X+10&gt; GiB (&lt;n+2560&gt; extents).
Logical volume mylv successfully resized.</p>
<p>We can confirm that the change was successful by running:</p>
<p>$ sudo lvdisplay /dev/myvg/mylv
&mdash; Logical volume &mdash;
LV Path                /dev/myvg/mylv
LV Name                mylv
VG Name                myvg
LV UUID                0z91UE-XjqJ-oNc1-w0si-CSPc-x0iu-xOqtW8
LV Write Access        read/write
LV Creation host, time localhost, 2022-03-01 21:09:42 +00:00
LV Status              available</p>
<h1 id="open-----------------1">open                 1</h1>
<p>LV Size                30.00 GiB
Current LE             7680
Segments               2
Allocation             inherit
Read ahead sectors     auto</p>
<ul>
<li>currently set to     256
Block device           253:0</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we can see that our logical volume has been increased in size to 30GB.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Using LVM for disk management and expansion offers great flexibility and enables us to dynamically manage disk space on our systems. We can easily create physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes, and expand logical volumes without any downtime. In this post, we have gone through the steps of creating physical volumes, volume groups, logical volumes, and expanding logical volumes.</p>
