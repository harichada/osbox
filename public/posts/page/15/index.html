      In the world of computing, booting up a system can be considered as the beginning of everything. It is the process where the computer, without any user intervention or input, runs through a sequence of operations that leads to the loading of the operating system. But sometimes, things don&rsquo;t always go as planned, and the computer fails to boot up properly. In this blog post, we will discuss some of the most common boot issues that users may encounter and how to troubleshoot them.

      Introduction
Firewalls and routing are some of the core components of network security. They help to secure networks by controlling the flow of traffic, regulating access to network resources, and managing the routing of data between devices. However, these security measures can sometimes cause problems for users, resulting in network connectivity issues. In this post, we&rsquo;ll look at some common firewall and routing issues, and provide troubleshooting tips to help you resolve them.

      Troubleshooting SSL Issues: Understanding SSL and How to Fix Problems with SSL Certificates
When you are browsing the internet, you may have noticed the little green padlock in your address bar. This padlock indicates that the website you are visiting is secured with SSL, or &ldquo;Secure Sockets Layer&rdquo; technology. SSL is a protocol that provides secure connections (encrypted) between web servers and web browsers. It is used to secure online transactions, such as credit card payments, online banking, and other private communications.

      Understanding and Configuring System Resource Limits
When working with a computer system, we need to ensure that it behaves as expected and can handle the workload we put on to it. For this purpose, we need to carefully define and configure the limits of system resources such as CPU usage, memory allocation, disk space, and network I/O. In this blog post, we will discuss the importance of understanding and configuring these resource limits, as well as how to set them up on a Linux-based system.

      Introduction
Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a method of disk management and expansion that allows for the creation of logical volumes (LVs) from physical volumes (PVs) to provide flexible and dynamic disk space management. It is used on systems that have a need for increased storage capacity, such as a server or a workstation. In this post, we will discuss how to use LVM for disk management and expansion.
