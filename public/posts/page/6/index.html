      Fraud Detection with a Machine Learning Algorithm
With the increased use of online transactions, fraud detection has become a critical aspect for many businesses. The traditional rule-based methods of fraud detection are good, but they are not efficient in detecting complex fraud patterns. Machine learning algorithms are great alternatives for these situations. They have the ability to identify complex patterns in data with high accuracy. In this blog post, we will explore how machine learning algorithms can be used for fraud detection.

      Fraud Detection with Deep Learning: An Overview
Fraud is a prevalent problem in virtually all industries, especially in financial services. Businesses lose millions of dollars every year through various forms of fraud such as credit card fraud, insurance fraud, and fake identities. The need for advanced surveillance systems to detect fraud is thus paramount. Fraudulent activities are often complex and hard to detect through traditional methods. Deep Learning (DL) models have emerged as powerful tools for detecting fraud in real-time.

      Generative models are machine learning algorithms that can learn from observed data points to produce new data points that possess similar characteristics to the original dataset. These models generate new data by modeling the distribution of the original dataset, allowing them to create samples that are statistically similar to the original data.
One of the most popular generative models is the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), introduced in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, is a fascinating concept.
