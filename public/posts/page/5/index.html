      Dependency Parsing with Spacy
Introduction
Dependency parsing is a crucial concept in natural language processing that involves extracting the relationships between words (tokens) in a sentence. The process involves analyzing the syntactic structure of a sentence, where each token is linked to its corresponding grammatical role, to determine how the words relate to each other. In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore how to perform dependency parsing with Spacy, a popular Python library used for natural language processing tasks.

      Emotion Recognition with OpenCV: An Overview
Emotion recognition is a computer vision technique that involves detecting and interpreting human emotions from visual data, typically facial expressions. It is a complex task that requires analyzing various facial features such as the shape and orientation of the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and nose, as well as factors like the person&rsquo;s skin color, age, and gender.
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a widely used open-source computer vision library that provides various features to analyze and manipulate visual data.
