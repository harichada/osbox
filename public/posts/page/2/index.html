Introduction
The search engine is an essential tool that helps users find relevant content within a vast pool of information. Search engines utilize a range of techniques to match user queries with relevant documents, including keyword matching, indexing, and semantic analysis. However, these traditional search techniques have some significant limitations, such as high dependence on user input, lack of context, and interpretation of user intent.
