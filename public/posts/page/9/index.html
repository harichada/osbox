      Managing services and daemons on the system is a crucial aspect of system administration. Services and daemons are programs or background processes that run on a system continuously or on demand to perform specific tasks or functions. Examples of services include web servers, database servers, email servers, and file servers, while examples of daemons include syslogd, xinetd, and samba. In this blog post, we will discuss the different methods used to manage services and daemons on a Linux system.
