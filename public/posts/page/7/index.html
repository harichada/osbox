      Introduction
Image segmentation is a key task in computer vision where the aim is to separate an image into different regions or objects. One of the most popular approaches to image segmentation is using deep learning, where neural networks are trained to categorize pixels in an image into different classes. In this blog post, we will discuss the basics of image segmentation using deep learning and explore a popular neural network architecture for this task.
