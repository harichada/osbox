## 21. Arduino AI And Machine Learning Libraries
    ### Introduction
    In recent years, there has been a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), with these technologies beginning to permeate a wide range of industries and applications. While AI and ML still have some way to go before becoming mainstream, their potential is already starting to be realized in fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing.
    One area that has seen a lot of excitement and activity in recent years is the field of embedded AI, where AI and ML algorithms are deployed on devices at the edge of the network. This is made possible by the increasing power and capabilities of edge devices, as well as the availability of open-source AI and ML libraries.
    In this blog post, we will take a look at some of the most popular open-source AI and ML libraries for the Arduino platform. We will discuss the key features of each library, and provide examples of how they can be used to build AI and ML applications.
