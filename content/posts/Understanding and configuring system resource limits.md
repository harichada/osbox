# Understanding and Configuring System Resource Limits
## Introduction:
System resource limits play an essential role in the proper functioning of any computer system. They are responsible for monitoring and controlling the allocation and consumption of critical system resources such as memory, CPU, disk I/O, etc. Configuring system resource limits is vital for the smooth running of complex software applications, particularly in fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science where memory and CPU utilization are significant concerns. In this blog post, we will discuss why understanding and configuring system resource limits is crucial, and how you can master this skill.
## Background:
There are several reasons why you would want to configure system resource limits. For instance, in a shared hosting environment, resource limits help prevent one user from monopolizing all system resources, which may negatively impact other users. In machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, resource limits help ensure that the training process does not crash the system or cause it to slow down to an unusable state. Resource limits also help prevent runaway processes, which could lead to system crashes.
In Linux, system resource limits are defined in the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file. This file contains rules that specify the various resource limits for users or user groups. By default, most Linux distributions set some soft limits for system resources.
## Detailed Steps in Resolving the Issue:
To configure system resource limits, follow the steps below:
#### Step 1: Create a User Group
Assuming you want to apply resource limits to a specific group of users, you need first to create the group. To create a group called `usergroup`, run the following command:
```
sudo groupadd usergroup
```
#### Step 2: Edit the Limits Configuration File
Open the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file in your favorite text editor:
```
sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf
```
To set a hard limit of 4GB for virtual memory for all users in the `usergroup` group, add the following line to the `limits.conf` file:
```
@usergroup hard as 4000000
```
To set a soft limit of 3GB for virtual memory, add the following line:
```
@usergroup soft as 3000000
```
To set a limit of 500MB for maximum locked memory, add the following line:
```
@usergroup hard memlock 500000
```
#### Step 3: Restart the System
After editing the `limits.conf` file, you need to restart the system to apply the changes:
```
sudo reboot
```
#### Step 4: Verify the Changes
After the system reboots, you can verify the resource limits by running the command `ulimit -a`. The command displays all limits for the current user:
```
ulimit -a
```
## Commands Required to Know to Work on the Issue:
Here are some of the commands you need to know when working with system resource limits:
- `ulimit`: displays resource limits for the current user.
- `ulimit -n`: sets the maximum number of open files.
- `ulimit -a`: displays all resource limits for the current user.
- `ulimit -H -d`: displays the maximum data size a process can have.
- `ulimit -H -m`: displays the maximum resident set size a process can use.
- `ulimit -H -s`: displays the maximum stack size a process can have.
- `ulimit -H -t`: displays the maximum CPU time a process can use.
