Collaborative filtering for music recommendation systems
Are you tired of endlessly scrolling through streaming services looking for music to listen to? Collaborative filtering could be the solution. In this blog post, we will explore how collaborative filtering can be used for music recommendation systems using open-source hardware and software.
What is collaborative filtering?
Collaborative filtering is a technique used by recommendation systems to identify new items or content that users may be interested in based on their past behaviors or preferences. It is a statistical algorithm that uses similarity metrics to match users together based on their past interactions with the same item or content.
In the context of music recommendation systems, collaborative filtering can be used to suggest new songs or artists that users may enjoy based on their listening history.
Hardware and software requirements
Before we dive into coding, let's discuss the hardware and software requirements for this project.
Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- USB microphone
Software:
- Python (version 3 or higher)
- scikit-learn (machine learning library)
- numpy (mathematical library)
- pandas (data manipulation library)
- pyaudio (audio library)
Building the music recommendation system
Step 1: Data collection
The first step in creating a music recommendation system is to collect data. For this project, we will use the Million Song Dataset, which contains information about one million songs.
We will use the following features to create our recommendation system:
- artist_name
- title
- year
- tempo
- energy
- danceability
- loudness
Step 2: Data preprocessing
After collecting the data, the next step is to preprocess it. We will use pandas to clean, transform and combine our data into the required format.
Step 3: Building the recommendation model
Now that we have our data in the required format, we can use scikit-learn to build our recommendation model. We will be using a nearest neighbors algorithm to find songs that are similar to the ones that the user has previously listened to.
Step 4: User input
To create an interactive recommendation system, we will use a USB microphone to allow users to input the name of the song they are currently listening to. We will then use this input to return a list of recommended songs.
Here is the Python code to implement the music recommendation system:
```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import numpy as np
import pyaudio
# Data collection
data = pd.read_csv('msd_genre_dataset.txt')
# Data preprocessing
data = data[['artist_name', 'title', 'year', 'tempo', 'energy', 'danceability', 'loudness']]
data = data.dropna()
features = data[['tempo', 'energy', 'danceability', 'loudness']]
target = data[['artist_name', 'title']]
# Building the recommendation model
model = NearestNeighbors(metric='euclidean')
model.fit(features)
# User input
p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=44100, input=True, frames_per_buffer=2048)
print('Listening...')
while True:
   data = np.fromstring(stream.read(2048), dtype=np.int16)
   peak=np.average(np.abs(data))*2
   if peak > 500:
      query = input("Enter the name of the song you are currently listening to: ")
      input_data = data[['tempo', 'energy', 'danceability', 'loudness']]
      distances, indices = model.kneighbors([input_data])
      print(target.iloc[indices[0]])
``` 
Conclusion
Collaborative filtering is a powerful tool that can help us create more personalized music recommendation systems. By using open-source hardware and software, we can create innovative projects that leverage the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In this blog post, we have covered the step-by-step process of creating a music recommendation system using collaborative filtering. From data collection and preprocessing to building the recommendation model and user input, we have shown you how to create an interactive music recommendation system that can help you discover new music.
Remember, this is just the beginning. There is always room for improvement and experimentation in the field of machine learning and AI. So, keep exploring and keep innovating.Collaborative filtering for music recommendation systems
