# Managing the Filesystem Hierarchy and Directory Structure
## Introduction
The filesystem hierarchy and directory structure is critical to the functioning of a Linux system. It is the way in which Linux organizes files in directories and subdirectories, making it easy for users to find and access their files. Linux follows a standard file organization structure defined by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which defines the layout of the Linux system directory tree. In this blog post, we'll discuss the importance of managing the filesystem hierarchy and directory structure, how to optimize it for better performance, and the best practices to keep it organized.
## Background
The file management system in Linux has been in existence for many years, and its evolution has resulted in a robust and stable file system directory structure. However, managing file systems can be challenging, especially in large organizations where there are multiple users and applications. When the directory structure is disorganized, it can lead to difficulties in locating files and increased downtime. Therefore, it's essential to keep the filesystem hierarchy and directory structure organized and optimized.
## Detailed Steps
To optimize the file hierarchy, you need to follow some simple steps:
### 1. Create a root directory
Make sure to create a root directory to streamline the directory structure. The root directory is the first directory in the Linux file system, and all other directories stem from it. 
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /rootdir/    
```
### 2. Group related files
Group related files into directories to improve accessibility and ease of management. The directory naming convention should be based on their purpose.
```bash
sudo mkdir /rootdir/files
sudo mkdir /rootdir/configs
```
### 3. Use symbolic links
Symbolic links can make it easier to access files in different directories. You can use the following command to create a symbolic link:
```
ln -s /path/to/target /path/to/link
```
### 4. Manage Permissions
Ensure that users have permissions only to access files and directories that they need. It's easy to compromise security when all users can access all files.
```bash
chmod 755 /rootdir/
chown username:groupname /rootdir/
```
## Command Requirements
### pwd
The `pwd` command displays the current working directory path.
```bash
pwd
```
### cd
The `cd` command allows you to change to a different directory. 
```bash
cd /rootdir/
```
### ls
The `ls` command lists the files in your current directory.
```bash
ls -l
```
