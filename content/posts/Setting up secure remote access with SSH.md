# Setting Up Secure Remote Access with SSH
## Introduction
Remote access allows users to access a machine or network from a different location. While remote access provides many benefits, it is also a security risk. Hackers may gain access to sensitive information if security measures are not in place. SSH, or Secure Shell, is an effective method for securing remote access. In this blog post, we will discuss the steps required to set up secure remote access with SSH.
## Background
SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that provides an encrypted connection between a client and a server. One of the most significant benefits of SSH is that it encrypts all data transmitted between the client and the server, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Remote access is generally used for two purposes: administering a server and accessing files stored on a remote system. If you are an administrator, you will need to use SSH to execute commands remotely. On the other hand, if you want to access files, you can use SSH to securely transfer files between clients and servers.
## Detailed Steps
Step 1: Install OpenSSH on the server
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
Step 2: Verify that the SSH service is running
```
systemctl status ssh
```
Step 3: Update the SSH configuration 
```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Step 4: Edit the following parameters to improve security
```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
```
Step 5: Restart the SSH service
```
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
Step 6: Generate a public and private key pair on the client machine 
```
ssh-keygen
```
Step 7: Copy the public key to the server
```
ssh-copy-id user@server
```
Step 8: Test the connection
```
ssh user@server
```
## Commands
1. To install OpenSSH, use:
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
2. To verify the SSH service's status, use:
```
systemctl status ssh
```
3. To update the SSH configuration, use:
```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
4. To restart the SSH service, use:
```
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
5. To generate key pairs, use:
```
ssh-keygen
```
6. To copy the public key to the server, use:
```
ssh-copy-id user@server
```
7. To test the connection, use:
```
ssh user@server
```
