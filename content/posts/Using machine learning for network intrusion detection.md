# Using Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection
With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks, it has become essential for companies to take proactive measures to protect their systems from unauthorized access. One of the most effective ways to prevent network intrusions is through machine learning, which uses advanced algorithms to detect and respond to potential threats in real-time.
In this blog post, we will explore how to create a project using open-source hardware and software that leverages machine learning to achieve impressive results in network intrusion detection. We will cover everything from selecting the right hardware and software to writing code snippets that bring your project to life.
## Step 1: Choosing the Right Hardware and Software
To get started with your project, you will need to choose the right hardware and software. For this project, we'll be using the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and the Pi-hole software.
### Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is a small and affordable computer that is ideal for developing ML and AI projects. It can be powered using a USB-C cable and can connect to various displays and peripherals using HDMI and USB ports. With its 1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72 CPU, it provides significant processing power to run machine learning algorithms.
### Pi-hole
Pi-hole is an open-source software that acts as a network-level ad blocker and DNS sinkhole. It can be used to block ads, malware, and phishing domains on your entire network. For this project, we will use Pi-hole to log all network traffic and use it as a data source for our machine learning model.
## Step 2: Collecting the Data
Before we can start building our machine learning model, we need to collect data on network traffic. We will use Pi-hole to log all DNS queries made by devices on our network.
``` python
# Install Pi-hole
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
# Logging DNS queries
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/99-pihole.conf
```
Add the following line to the file and save it:
```
:msg, contains, "query" /var/log/pihole.log
```
Restart the rsyslog service to apply the changes:
``` python
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```
## Step 3: Preparing the Data
Now that we have logged network traffic data, we need to clean and prepare it for use in our machine learning model. We can do this using Python and the Pandas library.
``` python
# Importing the Pandas library
import pandas as pd
# Reading the log file
log = pd.read_csv('/var/log/pihole.log', delimiter='\t')
# Cleaning the data
log = log.dropna()
log = log[~log['domain'].str.contains('localhost|127.0.0.1')]
```
## Step 4: Building the Machine Learning Model
The next step in our project is building the machine learning model that will detect network intrusions. We can use the Scikit-learn library in Python to create our model.
``` python
# Importing the Scikit-learn library
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
# Preparing the data for the model
X = log[['client', 'query_type']]
y = log['status']
# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
# Creating the model
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Evaluating the model
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```
## Step 5: Testing the Model
Now that we have built our machine learning model, the final step is testing it to see how well it performs. We can do this by introducing some simulated network intrusions and analyzing how the model responds.
``` python
# Simulating a network intrusion
test_data = pd.DataFrame({'client': ['192.168.1.10'], 'query_type': ['A']})
# Predicting the status
status = clf.predict(test_data)
print('Status:', status)
```
