# Managing System Processes and Priorities
## Introduction
System processes and priorities are an essential aspect of operating systems. In computer science, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. When several processes are running at the same time, the operating system must manage their priorities to allocate system resources efficiently. As a developer or administrator, it is essential to be familiar with process management because it affects the overall performance of the system. This post will explain the concepts of system processes and priorities, reasons that cause the issue, and provide detailed steps in resolving the issue with code snippets.
## Background
System processes management became essential because of two reasons. Firstly, multiple processes running parallel with less RAM will result in a system crash or halt. Secondly, disk I/O and scheduling of processes is an overhead for CPU processing. This overhead on CPU and RAM resources need to be maintained and optimized as many other background services are also present in the system to take up resources. Due to these reasons, Linux provides the way to manage processes and their priorities.
## Detailed Steps in Resolving the Issue
In Linux, we can use commands like `top`, `htop`, and `ps` to view system processes and their details like CPU and memory usage, process ID (PID), and priority. We can also use the `renice` command to change the priority of running processes. `renice` changes the priority of NICE values, having a range of -20 to 19, which translate to priority values ranging from 19 to -20.
### Changing Process Priority
Here's an example code snippet to change the priority of a running process:
```
renice +5 1234
```
This command increases the priority of process ID 1234 by 5 units.
### Viewing Current Process Priorities
Here's an example code snippet to view the current priorities of all running processes:
```
ps -eo pid,nice,cmd
```
This command lists all PIDs, the nice value for each process, and the command line associated with that process.
## Commands Required to Work on the Issue
Some commonly used commands for managing system processes and priorities are:
- `top`: display system processes and their usage.
- `htop`: an interactive version of `top`.
- `pstree`: display running processes in tree format.
- `kill`: terminate a running process.
- `ps`: list current system processes.
- `renice`: change process priority.

In conclusion, managing system processes and priorities is crucial for optimizing system resources. As a developer or administrator, it is crucial to be proficient with the tools and commands necessary for managing processes. The Linux commands top, htop, ps, renice are essential for identifying and managing processes. With these tools and commands, you can optimize system performance and prevent system crashes or halts.# Managing System Processes and Priorities
