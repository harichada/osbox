## 12. Managing User Accounts and Permissions

### Introduction

Managing user accounts and permissions is an essential task in any system that requires user authentication and access control. User accounts refer to the identity of a person or an entity that uses the system, while permissions define what actions a user can take within the system. The significance of managing user accounts and permissions effectively is to ensure that unauthorized users cannot access restricted data or functionalities. 

### Background

In contemporary software development, managing user accounts and permissions is not just limited to username and password authentication systems. More advanced authentication and authorization mechanisms such as OAuth, openID Connect, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) have become increasingly popular. Consequently, developers must understand the concept of roles, access control lists (ACLs), and resource-based policies to grant permissions to users effectively.

### Steps to Manage User Accounts and Permissions

Below are the steps to follow in managing user accounts and permissions effectively:

1. Define User Groups: User groups are a way of categorizing users based on how they interact with the system. Examples of user groups include administrators, moderators, and regular users. Defining user groups helps in providing role-based or policy-based permissions management.

2. Define User Roles: User roles define the set of permissions required by users to perform various functions within the system. For example, a moderator role might have permissions to approve comments, while an admin role might have the ability to manage user accounts. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a commonly used access control mechanism.

3. Set Object Permissions: Object Permissions control what actions a user can take on a particular object, e.g., a file, a URL, or a database. Setting object permissions involves defining a list of permissions that a role or user can have, such as update, delete, or create. This step is necessary to ensure that only authorized users can perform actions.

4. Implement Access Control Lists: Access Control Lists (ACLs) define the permissions of each user or group to a resource. For instance, an ACL could specify that a user or group has read-only access on a particular folder, while another user or group can modify the folder. ACLs are useful in defining user permissions on objects with different levels of access.

5. Use Resource-based Policies: Resource-based policies define what actions a user or group can take on specified resources. For example, an S3 bucket policy can be used to grant or deny a particular user or group access to specific buckets.

### Commands to Know

To manage user accounts and permissions in a Linux system, below are some commands you need to know:

- adduser: adds a new user account on the system.
- usermod: modifies an existing user account.
- passwd: sets a new password for a user account.
- chown: changes the owner of a file or directory.
- chmod: changes the permission bits of a file or directory.
- groups: lists the groups a user belongs to.
