# Building Recommendation Systems Using Collaborative Filtering
If you've ever used Netflix or Amazon, chances are you've encountered a recommendation system. These systems use machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and predict which items they may be interested in. Collaborative filtering is a popular technique used in building such recommendation systems. In this blog post, we'll explore the process of building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
## What is Collaborative Filtering?
Collaborative filtering is a technique used in machine learning to analyze user data for recommendations. It is based on the idea that people who have similar interests in the past are likely to have similar preferences in the future. Collaborative filtering recommends items to users based on their past behavior, and the behavior of similar users.
Collaborative filtering can be broken down into two types: user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. In user-based collaborative filtering, recommendations are made to a user based on the behavior of similar users. In item-based collaborative filtering, recommendations are made to a user based on the behavior of similar items.
## The Process of Building a Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering
Now that we understand what collaborative filtering is, let's look at the process of building a recommendation system using this technique.
### Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation
The first step in building a recommendation system is to collect and prepare the data. This involves gathering data on users and their past behavior, as well as data on the items being recommended. The data should be clean and well-structured to ensure accurate results.
For this tutorial, we'll be using the MovieLens dataset. This dataset contains movie ratings from a group of users, and we'll use this data to build our recommendation system.
```python
import pandas as pd 
# load the dataset
ratings_df = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
movies_df = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
# prepare the data
movie_ratings_df = pd.merge(movies_df, ratings_df)
movie_ratings_df.drop(['timestamp'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```
### Step 2: Model Creation
The next step is to create the model. We'll be using the Surprise library for this, which provides an easy-to-use interface for building recommendation systems. 
```python
!pip install surprise
from surprise import KNNBasic
from surprise import Dataset
from surprise import Reader
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split
# define the reader and load the data
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(0.5, 5.0))
data = Dataset.load_from_df(movie_ratings_df[['userId', 'movieId', 'rating']], reader)
# split the data into train and test sets
trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.25)
# define the model and fit it to the data
sim_options = {'name': 'cosine', 'user_based': False}
model = KNNBasic(sim_options=sim_options)
model.fit(trainset)
```
### Step 3: Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data. In this case, we'll use the model to predict which movies a user may be interested in based on their past behavior.
```python
# get user 1's ratings
user_ratings = movie_ratings_df[movie_ratings_df['userId']==1]
# create a list of movies user 1 hasn't rated
new_ratings = movie_ratings_df[~movie_ratings_df['movieId'].isin(user_ratings['movieId'])]['movieId']
# predict the ratings for the new movies
predictions = [model.predict('1', movieId) for movieId in new_ratings]
```
### Step 4: Evaluating the Model
The final step in building a recommendation system is to evaluate the model's performance. We can use metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure the accuracy of our model.
```python
from surprise import accuracy
# evaluate the model
test_predictions = model.test(testset)
accuracy.rmse(test_predictions)
accuracy.mae(test_predictions)
```
## Conclusion
Collaborative filtering is a powerful technique for building recommendation systems. By analyzing user data, we can make personalized recommendations that take into account the user's past behavior and preferences. With tools like Surprise, building a recommendation system is easier than ever before. Give it a try and see how well it performs on your own data!
