# Automated Backups Using Cron Jobs

## Introduction
Automated backups are an essential part of ensuring data safety and business continuity. A backup strategy ensures that even if there is a power outage, a hard disk failure, or any other unexpected catastrophe, your data is secure and can be recovered without significant data loss.

In this tutorial, we'll discuss how you can set up automated backups using cron jobs. Cron is a built-in Unix utility, that enables programs and scripts to run automatically at set times and intervals.

We'll cover how to configure cron jobs to schedule backups, write scripts for backing up data, and provide links to additional resources.

## Background
Your data is precious and needs to be protected from a range of threats. As a result, it's critical to backup files regularly. However, manual backups are time-consuming, prone to mistakes, and not very reliable.

One possible solution is to use a cloud backup service, but it's still essential to have local backups as a redundancy measure. This is where automated backups come in handy. 

This tutorial provides a method to automate backups on a Unix system, which is a popular operating system used by developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.

## Detailed Steps in Resolving the Issue in Code Snippets

First, we need to create a backup script. You can create a new file in your preferred text editor and enter the following code:

```
#!/bin/sh

#set the backup directory and file name
backup_dir="/backup"
backup_file="backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M).tar.gz"

#create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$backup_dir" ]; then
  mkdir $backup_dir
fi

#archive and compress the backup files
tar -zcvf $backup_dir/$backup_file /var/www/html
```

This script sets the backup directory and filename using the current date and time. If the backup directory doesn't exist, it's created. The script then archives and compresses the backup files.

Once you've saved the script, give it execute permission:

```
chmod +x /path/to/backup-script.sh
```

Now, use the crontab utility to schedule the script to run automatically:

```
crontab -e
```

This command opens the crontab editor. You can then add your script to the crontab file by adding the following line:

```
0 0 * * * /path/to/backup-script.sh
```

This command schedules the script to run every day at midnight. The five time fields represent minutes, hours, the day of the month, the month, and the day of the week.

Finally, save the crontab file to activate the backup:

```
crontab: installing new crontab
```

## Command Required to Know to Work on the Issue

Cron jobs can be complicated to use effectively. Here are some commands that are useful for working with cron jobs:

- `crontab -e`: This command opens the crontab editor for configuring cron jobs.
- `crontab -l`: This command lists the current cron jobs.
- `crontab -r`: This command removes all the cron jobs for the current user.
