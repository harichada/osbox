# Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning
Are you looking to create an innovative project that combines the power of AI, ML, and open-source hardware and software? In this blog post, we will explore the step-by-step process of creating a project that leverages these technologies to achieve impressive results. From selecting the right hardware and software to writing code snippets that bring your project to life, we'll cover it all. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, this blog post will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to get started on your own ML and AI project. So, let's get started!
## What is Anomaly Detection?
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that do not conform to the expected pattern or standard behavior of a given dataset. In other terms, it is the process of identifying outliers in the dataset. Anomaly detection is employed in various fields such as fraud detection, fault detection in machines, intrusion detection in networks, and many others.
## Hardware and Software Requirements
To get started with our anomaly detection project, we will need the following hardware and software:
### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi
- GrovePi+
- Grove - Air Quality Sensor
### Software
- Python 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit Learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy
## Step 1: Setting up Hardware
Firstly, we need to set up the hardware. Connect the GrovePi+ board into the Raspberry Pi and then connect the Grove - Air Quality Sensor to the board.
## Step 2: Collecting Data
Now we can start collecting the data from the air quality sensor. We can use a Jupyter notebook running on the Raspberry Pi to write our Python code that collects the data. To collect the data from the air quality sensor, we will use the following code snippet:
```
import time
from grovepi import *
import math
sensor = 0
grovepi.pinMode(sensor,"INPUT")
# Wait for sensor to settle
time.sleep(2)
# Collect readings
data = []
for i in range(10):
    data.append(analogRead(sensor))
    time.sleep(0.5)
# Convert readings to AQI
def aqi_conversion(x):
    y = (math.log(x))*1.25506 + 1.82283
    return y
aqi = []
for i in range(len(data)):
    aqi.append(aqi_conversion(data[i]))
print('Air Quality Index:', aqi)
```
This code will collect ten readings from the sensor, with a delay of 0.5 seconds between each reading. The readings are then converted into an Air Quality Index (AQI) using a formula.
## Step 3: Preprocessing the Data
Once we have collected the data, we need to preprocess it before we can train our ML model. We will first convert the sensor readings into a pandas dataframe and then visualize the data using matplotlib.
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Convert the data to a pandas dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(aqi, columns=['Air Quality Index'])
# Visualize the data
df.plot()
plt.show()
```
This will produce a scatter plot of the AQI readings.

## Step 4: Training the Machine Learning Model
Now that we have preprocessed the data, we can train our machine learning model to detect anomalies in the dataset. We will use the IsolationForest algorithm from Scikit Learn to train our model.
```
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
# Train the model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)
model.fit(df)
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(df)
predictions[predictions == 1] = 0
predictions[predictions == -1] = 1
```
We have set the contamination parameter to 0.01, which means we expect only 1% of the data to be anomalous. The predictions are then made using the predict method of the IsolationForest object.
## Step 5: Visualizing the Results
Finally, we can visualize the results of our anomaly detection model.
```
# Plot the predictions
plt.scatter(df.index, df['Air Quality Index'], c=predictions)
plt.show()
```

The red data points in the above scatter plot represent the predicted anomalies in the dataset.
## Conclusion
In this blog post, we have seen how to create an anomaly detection project using machine learning, open-source hardware, and software. We have covered the entire process from collecting data to visualizing the results. With this project, we can detect anomalous data points in any dataset and take appropriate action. We hope this blog post has provided you with the knowledge and tools you need to get started on your own machine learning and AI projects.
