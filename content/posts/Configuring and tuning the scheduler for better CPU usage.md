# Configuring and Tuning the Scheduler for Better CPU Usage
## Introduction
The scheduler is an important part of any operating system that determines which process should be executed by the CPU. It's responsible for allocating resources to processes and managing them efficiently. In this blog post, we'll discuss how to configure and tune the scheduler for better CPU usage.
## Background
Poor CPU usage can lead to slow response times, resource wastage, and inefficient resource allocation. Some of the factors that may cause this issue include interference between multiple processes, inefficient scheduling algorithms, and inappropriate CPU allocation. 
To resolve these issues, we can configure and tune the scheduler to optimize CPU usage by balancing system performance, responsiveness and energy efficiency.
## Detailed Steps
To configure and tune the scheduler for better CPU usage, follow these steps:
### Step 1: Choose a Suitable Scheduler
Different operating systems come with different schedulers with varying performance characteristics. To choose the right scheduler, you need to consider factors such as system load, the number of cores your CPU has, and your overall performance requirements.
For example, some popular schedulers include the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), the Real-time scheduler (RT), and the Deadline Scheduler (DDL), among others. The CFS is the default scheduler for most modern Linux kernels, and it's suitable for general-purpose workloads. On the other hand, RT and DDL are ideal for real-time applications that require deterministic performance.
### Step 2: Adjust Kernel Parameters
Kernel parameters are critical in determining how the scheduler behaves, especially in terms of resource allocation and scheduling. You can adjust kernel parameters using the `sysctl` command or by editing the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file.
For example, you can change the value of the `sched_latency_ns` parameter to control the maximum delay a process can experience before getting scheduled. Similarly, you can adjust the `sched_migration_cost_ns` parameter to control the cost of migrating a process from one CPU core to another.
### Step 3: Monitor System Load
Monitoring system load is crucial in determining how well the scheduler is performing. You can use tools such as `top` or `htop` to view system load in real-time and identify processes that consume too much CPU time.
You can also use tools such as `perf` or `sysstat` to analyze system performance over an extended period, enabling you to identify trends and patterns in system load.
### Step 4: Prioritize CPU Time
By default, the scheduler assigns an equal amount of CPU time to all running processes. However, you can prioritize CPU time using process niceness.
Niceness is a value that ranges from -20 to 19 and represents the priority of a process. A negative value indicates high priority, while a positive value indicates low priority. You can use the `nice` command to change the niceness value of a process.
For example, to give a process high priority, you can run:
```
nice -n -10 <command>
```
Where `-n -10` sets the niceness value to -10, indicating high priority.
### Step 5: Use CPU Pinning
CPU pinning is a technique that enables you to assign specific CPU cores to specific processes. By doing so, you can avoid CPU core sharing and prevent interference between processes.
You can use tools such as `taskset` or `numactl` to bind processes to specific CPU cores.
For example, to pin a process to CPU core 1, you can run:
```
taskset -c 1 <command>
```
## Commands Required
Here are some important Linux commands that you can use to configure and tune the scheduler:
- `sysctl` - to adjust kernel parameters.
- `top` or `htop` - to view system load.
- `perf` or `sysstat` - to analyze system performance.
- `nice` - to change process niceness value.
- `taskset` or `numactl` - to pin processes to specific CPU cores.
