# Monitoring Hardware Sensors and Health

## Introduction
Hardware sensors and health monitoring allow us to keep track of the health status of our system components, such as temperature, voltage, and fan speed. This information is critical in ensuring optimal performance and preventing hardware failures. In this blog post, we will talk about how to monitor hardware sensors and health using open-source technologies.

## Background
Hardware malfunctions can be attributed to several factors, including environmental factors, system age, hardware configuration, and installation. The monitoring of hardware sensors and health can help us collect critical data to diagnose potential issues and prevent hardware failure.

## Detailed Steps in Resolving the Issue
The following steps are required to monitor hardware sensors and health:
1. Install lm-sensors- this can be achieved by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
```
2. Detect and configure hardware sensors- after installing lm-sensors successfully, detect and configure hardware sensors using the following command:
```
sudo sensors-detect
```
   Here, provide interactive prompts, and answer "yes" or "no" to each question presented. Sudo access is needed as the command accesses system files.
3. Display sensor readings- Run the following command to display sensor readings:
```
sensors
```

## Commands Required to Know to Work on the Issue
- `sudo apt-get install lm-sensors`: installs the lm-sensors package
- `sudo sensors-detect`: detects and configure hardware sensors
- `sensors`: displays sensor readings
