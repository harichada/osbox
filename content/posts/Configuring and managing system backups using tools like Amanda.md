# Configuring and Managing System Backups with Amanda
## Introduction
System backups are critical in ensuring that important data and files are not lost due to system failures or disasters. It is important for system administrators to know how to configure and manage backups using reliable tools like Amanda. In this blog post, we will discuss the key concepts of configuring and managing system backups using Amanda.
## Background
System backups help ensure that important files are safe from disasters like system failures or cyber attacks. With the increase in data collection and storage, it is essential to have a clear backup plan. Amanda is an open-source tool that is ideal for managing backups over a network of computers. It uses a client-server model to backup data from multiple client computers to the same server. 
## Detailed Steps in Resolving the Issue
### Installing Amanda on Ubuntu
To install Amanda on Ubuntu, use the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install amanda-server amanda-client
```
### Configuring Amanda
After installing Amanda, the next step is to configure it. Amanda configuration is done using the amanda.conf file located in the /etc/amanda directory. To configure Amanda, follow these steps:
1. Open the amanda.conf file using your editor of choice: `sudo nano /etc/amanda/amanda.conf`. This creates the configuration file.
2. Define the backup server by specifying the name and IP address: 
```
# Change the "mybackupserver" value to the name of your backup server.
# Change the "192.168.1.10" value to the IP address of your backup server.
servername mybackupserver.mydomain.com amanda-client-1
define tapetype DLT-IV
define changerfile "chg-disk"
define tapedev "file:/backup/backup-server/slots" 
```
3. Configure the disks to be backed up: 
```
define dumptype global {
tapesize 2g
auth "local"	
strategy standard
}
```
4. Save the file and exit. 
### Scheduling Amanda
After configuring Amanda, the next step is to schedule the backups. This is done using the crontab command. To schedule a backup, follow these steps:
1. Open the crontab file: `sudo crontab -e`.
2. Add the following line to run a full backup every day at 8 PM:
```
0 20 * * * /usr/sbin/amdump daily
```
3. Save the file and exit.
## Command Required to Know to Work on the Issue
- Installing Amanda on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install amanda-server amanda-client`.
- Creating the configuration file: `sudo nano /etc/amanda/amanda.conf`.
- Scheduling a backup: `sudo crontab -e`.
