# Managing Permissions and Access Control Lists
## Introduction
As technology advances and more and more people turn to digital systems, managing permissions and access control lists has become increasingly important. In essence, these tools enable administrators to control who can access specific resources, files, or directories, and what actions they can perform. This can be especially useful in large organisations with multiple users, where it is essential to limit access to sensitive data.
In this blog post, we will explore the concept of permissions and access control lists, their importance in modern computing, and how to manage them effectively.
## Background
Sometimes, it is necessary to restrict access to certain resources. For example, a finance department may want to prevent other employees from accessing sensitive financial information. Permissions can be used to selectively permit or deny access to files, directories or resources.
Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a more advanced way of controlling access. ACLs allow developers and administrators to set fine-grained permissions on specific resources. This can be very useful in complex systems where typos or errors can accidentally give users more access than intended. 
## Detailed Steps
To manage permissions and ACLs, you will typically need to use specialised tools. On a Unix-based system, the `chmod` command can be used to set file permissions. Windows systems have a similarly named `icacls` command. Here are the basic steps:
1. Identify the file, directory, or resource you want to set permissions for. 
2. Determine the level of access you want to grant or deny.
3. Use the `chmod` or `icacls` command to set the permissions.
4. Verify that the permissions are set correctly.
For example, to set read, write and execute permissions on a file using the `chmod` command, you would use the following command:
```bash
$ chmod 700 /path/to/file
```
This command would give the owner full access to the file (read, write and execute), while denying access to all other users.
In contrast, to grant a specific user or group access to a file using ACLs, you would use the following command:
```bash
$ setfacl -m user:username:rwx /path/to/file
```
This command would give the user named `username` read, write and execute access to the file.
## Commands to Know
Here are some common commands for managing permissions and ACLs on Unix and Windows systems:
**Unix Systems**
- `chmod` - changes file permissions.
- `chown` - changes file ownership.
- `chgrp` - changes the group owning a file.
- `ls -l` - lists file permissions.
**Windows Systems**
- `icacls` - changes permissions for files/directories.
- `takeown`- every file and directory must have an owner. "Take ownership" is a command added to Windows Vista to take ownership of a file or a folder.
- `cacls` - used to display or modify ACLs for files and folders.
- `dir /q` - lists the ownership and ACL of files and directories.
