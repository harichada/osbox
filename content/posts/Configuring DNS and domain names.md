# Configuring DNS and Domain Names
## Introduction
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses, which computers use to identify each other on the internet. It is an essential component of the internet infrastructure and critical to the proper functioning of web services. In this blog post, we will be exploring the steps involved in configuring DNS and domain names, the benefits of doing so and the commands involved.
## Background
There are several reasons why you might want to configure DNS and domain names, including:
- Branding: You might want to use a custom domain name that reflects your brand or business.
- Security: Configuring DNS and domain names can greatly improve security management by enabling you to block access to malicious websites, among other things.
- Load balancing: You can use DNS to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers for improved performance and availability.
## Detailed Steps
To configure DNS and domain names, follow these steps:
1. Choose a domain name registrar that suits your needs, such as Google Domains, Namecheap, or GoDaddy.
2. Create an account with the registrar and search for available domain names that suit your business or brand.
3. Once you have selected a domain name, register it with your preferred registrar.
4. Configure your DNS settings with the registrar. For example, you can add an A record that maps your domain name to your server's IP address.
5. Test your DNS configuration by running a DNS lookup using a tool like `dig` or `nslookup`.
Here is an example of an `A` record configuration using dig command:
```
$ dig mydomain.com A
; <<>> DiG 9.16.15-Debian <<>> mydomain.com A
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 31028
;; flags: qr rd ra ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 1452
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;mydomain.com.            IN      A
;; ANSWER SECTION:
mydomain.com.     299     IN      A       192.0.2.1
;; Query time: 21 msec
;; SERVER: 192.0.2.5#53(192.0.2.5)
;; WHEN: Thu Oct 14 08:31:59 UTC 2021
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 56
```
Here, we can see that mydomain.com is being mapped to the IP address 192.0.2.1.
## Commands required to work on the issue
The following commands are useful when working with DNS and domain names:
- `dig`: This command is used to perform DNS lookups and retrieve DNS-related information.
- `nslookup`: This command is also used for DNS lookups but is more basic than `dig`.
- `whois`: This command is used to retrieve domain registration information, such as contact details and registration dates.
