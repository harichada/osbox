# 11. Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues
As technology continues to develop and become more complex, connectivity issues have become a common occurrence in most systems. Connectivity issues prevent users from accessing various resources such as the internet, network drives and websites. 
In this blog post, we will be discussing the causes of connectivity issues, various tools to troubleshoot connectivity issues and steps to resolve connectivity issues.
## Background 
Connectivity issues can occur due to various reasons such as firewall settings, DNS issues, IP conflicts, misconfigured network hardware, and malware attacks. To understand which of these reasons may cause a connectivity issue, we need to know some of the common scenarios under which connectivity issues occur: 
1. Unable to access the internet
2. Unable to send or receive emails
3. Unable to access network drives
4. Unable to connect to remote access
5. Unable to establish a remote desktop connection
## Detailed steps in resolving the issue in code snippets. 
When users encounter connectivity issues, they usually begin by checking the connection status, rebooting the router, and running a few common network troubleshooting tools like ping and tracert. In this section, we will discuss a few detailed steps that will help resolve connectivity issues.
One of the first steps to resolve connectivity issues is to check the status of the network adapter. A network adapter is a hardware device that enables communication between the computer and network. A faulty network adapter can cause connectivity issues. 
To check the network adapter status on Windows, perform the following steps: 
```PowerShell
# Use the following command to check the network adapter status.
Get-NetAdapter
```
Another way to resolve connectivity issues is to reset the TCP/IP stack. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to establish communication between devices on the internet. 
To reset TCP/IP on Windows, perform the following steps: 
```PowerShell
# Use the following command to reset the TCP/IP stack.
netsh int ip reset
```
In addition to resetting the TCP/IP stack, you can also flush the DNS resolver cache. DNS (Domain Name System) is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.  
To flush DNS on Windows, perform the following steps: 
```PowerShell
# Use the following command to flush the DNS resolver cache.
ipconfig /flushdns
```
## Commands required to work on the issue
Apart from the commands covered previously, a few other commands that are useful in resolving connectivity issues are:
1. ping - to test connectivity to a remote host.
2. tracert - to troubleshoot the network path to a remote host.
3. nslookup - to query the DNS for the IP address of a host.
